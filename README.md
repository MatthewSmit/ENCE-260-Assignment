A simple game of Paper Scissors Rock that can be played
between two MCPs
Infra-red is used to communicate between the two devices, and pushing down
on the navigation pad on the menu will present the three choices.
After choosing one of either rock paper or scissors, the device will begin
waiting on the other device to choose, and after that they wil lbe able to
communicate and tell each other what was chosen.
The winner and loser will be displayed afterward and by pressing down again
on the dpad the game will automatically allow you to choose again.
